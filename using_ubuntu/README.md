# **Using Ubuntu**
It is assumed that you have made a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.10 before going ahead with this guide. If not, please check [here][1] for installation procedure.  
Now that you've installed Linux's most friendly desktop operating system, lets get started.

Some alternatives which may come in handy for you:

* [OpenOffice][2], the office suite having various desktop publishing tools
* [UbuntuOne][3], the cloud-backup service
* [Shotwell][4], the photo manager
* [Firefox][5], the web browser
* [Evolution][6], the e-mail client


----------


The best way of getting to know Ubuntu is to work on it, get the hang of it and finally master it. With regards to web-development, these are the applications that you will be required to know. 


### **Terminal**
The terminal is an interface in which you can type and execute text based commands. It can be much faster to complete some tasks using a Terminal than with graphical applications and menus. Another benefit is allowing access to many more commands and scripts.

* To open a terminal window press __Ctrl + Alt + T__ on your keyboard.
* Else, go to **Applications menu -> Accessories -> Terminal**.

Further steps about using the terminal given [here][7].
### **Browser**
Mozilla Firefox is a free open source web browser for the computer. It displays web pages written in the computer language HTML. It is made by the Mozilla Foundation. All your web-development tests and previews will be made on Mozilla Firefox.

* To open, open **Dash(_Super key_)** and type **Firefox**.
* Open terminal and type **Firefox** and press the **Enter** key.


### **Editor**
A text-editor is the one where you type out your code and create source code files. [Geany][8] is one such text editor with basic features of an integrated development environment. It was developed to provide a small and fast IDE, which has only a few dependencies from other packages.

* To install Geany, on your terminal do `sudo apt-get install geany`.
* You will be asked for root password to authenticate the installation.

Using Geany is fairly simple and you can check out detailed instructions [here][9].


And you're done.
